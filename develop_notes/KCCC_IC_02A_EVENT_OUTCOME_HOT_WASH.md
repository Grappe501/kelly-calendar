## Product outcome

Mobile-friendly post-Event review after scheduled end (or cancelled/postponed
disposition). Operators record attendance outcome, operational outcome, what
happened, takeaways, encounters, commitments, and follow-up needs.

## Fundamental rule

Time passing → `REVIEW_DUE` eligibility only. Never auto-complete. Never auto
not-attended. No Mission lifecycle mutation. No fabricated attendance/people/
consents/communications.

## Models

- `EventOutcomeReview` — optional 1:1, lazy-created on intentional write
- `EventHotWashEntry` — append-oriented; corrections append
- `EventEncounter` — people met without creating Person by default
- `EventOutcomeFollowUpLink` — soft link to `EventFollowup`
- `EventOutcomeAuditEntry` — append-only audit

Legacy thin `EventOutcome` remains untouched (not used by IC-02A UI).

## Eligibility

Service returns: `NOT_YET_DUE` | `REVIEW_DUE` | `DRAFT` | `REVIEWED` | `STALE` | `NOT_APPLICABLE`

## Routes

- `/system/events/[eventId]/outcome`
- `/system/events/[eventId]/hot-wash` → redirects to outcome
- `/system/calendar/reviews`
- `/system/calendar/reviews/report`

## APIs

- `GET/PATCH /api/events/[eventId]/outcome`
- `GET/POST /api/events/[eventId]/hot-wash`
- `POST /api/events/[eventId]/encounters`
- `POST /api/events/[eventId]/outcome/follow-up` (requires `confirmFollowUp: true`)
- `GET /api/events/[eventId]/outcome/report`
- `GET /api/calendar/reviews`

## Decisive proof (binding)

Allow one finished Event to become `REVIEW_DUE` without creating a database
record. Explicitly record `ATTENDED` + `COMPLETED`, add one takeaway and one
encounter, complete the review, then reload and reapply the same request with
zero duplicate reviews, takeaways, encounters, people, consents, communications,
Events, or Missions.
